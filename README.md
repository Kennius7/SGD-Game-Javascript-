Notes about the game:

1. There should be a sum that once reached, should result in a goal.
2. The passess should be controlled with some randomicity.
3. Initial sum is 20 points. After it hit 15 (3/4 of the sum value), the passes leave the defense/midfield region and focus on the midfield/attack region.
4. If the opponent gets the ball from the defense region of the player, a correct answer will lead to a goal.
5. Later on, when questions are categorized based on difficulty, answering certain number of questions will unlock the higher difficulties.
6. When the opponent gets the ball pass, 4 (1/5 of the sum value) points will be subtracted from the streak sum of the player.
7. Each pass adds 2 (1/10 of the sum value) points to the player streak sum value.
8. Once a goal is scored, streak values across board reset.
9. If the timer on the question that if answered correctly would elicit a goal, runs out, a goal shot is attempted but the Goalie catches the ball.
